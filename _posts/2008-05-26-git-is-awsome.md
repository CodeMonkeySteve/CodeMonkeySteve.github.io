title: Git is Awsome
---
I’ve spent the past month or so learning the ins and outs of [Git](http://git.or.cz/), and am in the process of converting from Subversion, both at work and for my personal projects. Others [have written](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git) about [Git’s awesomeness](http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive), and there are various of [comparisons with Subversion](http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSvnComparsion).

However, I think that comparing Git with Subversion as Version Control Systems is entirely missing the point: Git is a Source Code Management tool, although it can also be used for version control. The point of GIt is not to track the various versions of a project, but a connected series of *individual changes* made by individual developers. The change- and developer-centric view also makes for meaningful collaboration, instead of restricting access to a central Subversion server.

It is, undoubtedly, the New Hotness, and every coder should use it (or some other real SCM tool).
