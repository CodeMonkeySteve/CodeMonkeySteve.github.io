title: Small Footprint MongoDB
---
"MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ comes configured out of the box for maximum performance and reliability on production databases.  But it can be a bit of a disk hog, and if you're using a development environment with an "SSD":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssd like me (which I highly recommend), disk space might be scarce.  After doing a little research, I found configuration settings that significantly reduce MongoDB's disk usage.

Edit your MongoDB configuration file (@/etc/mongod.conf@) and add some/all of the following:

h3. @smallfiles = true@

Uses smaller data file sizes -- starting at 16MB instead of 128MB -- and create fewer files initially.  This can save almost 200MB on small collections (each!).

h3. @oplogsize = 100@ (MB)

If you're using an oplog for replication (or just for update notifications), you can set the size smaller than the default of "5% of all disk space".

h3. @nojournal = true@

MongoDB 2.0 introduced journaling, which is great for production environments, but not very useful in development.  You can disable it and save several GB.
