As of today, I've been with "Vigilos, Inc.":http://vigilos.com for exactly four months, a fact I was reminded of when the password expiration policy kicked in and I had to track down the admin to reset it.  While my days have been spent slogging through old crappy C code (and replacing it with shiny new C++ code), I been spend
ing evenings and weekends getting reacquainted with Ruby on Rails.  This has been inspired in large part by the Second Edition of "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://www.amazon.com/gp/amabot/?pf_rd_url=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0974514055%2Fref%3Dpd_cp_b_title%2F102-6241858-0226508&pf_rd_p=252362401&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0977616630&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=00B19H2M1TJWAHKNJJ56, an excellent book, both as tutorial and reference, and I highly recommend it to anyone doing Rails development.

After perusing the book cover-to-cover on my daily bus commute, I decided it was time to go back and rewrite my nominal web site ("finagle.org":http://finagle.org).  This was my first Rails project, back when Rails was only up to version _0.10_, and had quite a bit of cruft due to the ancient version (lots of stuff has changed since then) and my own lack of Ruby/Rails experience. Starting from scratch, following the book closely, and salvaging chunks of code from the original version, produced a much smaller and cleaner implementation.

Along the way, I also learned some new an interesting Rails development tricks.  I've been using "RadRails":http://www.radrails.org/ on my PowerBook laptop (_sooo_ much more responsive than running KDevelop over X11), which is a nice little IDE.  My only gripe is that it doesn't support "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/, but it's easy enough to run that in a shell.  I've also been using some rather spiffy plugins, some new some old:
* "manage_fixtures":http://svn.toolbocks.com/plugins/manage_fixtures allows for easy export/import of YAML fixtures to/from the data base,
* "acts_as_textiled":svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/acts_as_textiled handles converting models' Textile markup into HTML,
* "assert-valid-asset":http://www.realityforge.org/svn/public/code/assert-valid-asset/trunk is a great tool for automagically validating HTML and CSS.
* "backgroundrb":svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/backgroundrb provides facilities for executing long-running (or persistant) processes, and tying them into Rails.
* Finally, I'm using the "open_id_consumer":http://svn.eastmedia.com/svn/bantay/plugins/open_id_consumer plugin to handle logins via "OpenID":http://openid.net/.  Username/password is _so_ Web 1.0. ;)

Next up I need to hone my CSS skills a bit, maybe get a good _Agile Web_-style book on making pretty web themes.  Any suggestions?
