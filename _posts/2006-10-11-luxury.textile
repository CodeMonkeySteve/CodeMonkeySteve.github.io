If you're reading my obscure blog, you probably saw the "article on Slashdot":http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/35616214/article.pl linking to a "blog article":http://sztywny.titaniumhosting.com/2006/07/23/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answers/ where various notable programmers answer questions about their history and preferences.  My favorite has got to be:

<blockquote>
_How did you learn programming? Were any schools of any use? Or maybe you didn't even bother with ending any schools :) ?_

*"Steve Yegge":http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/*:
I taught myself to program on an HP calculator using their RPN stack language when I was 17 years old.
</blockquote>

Now, I'm a big fan of HP calculators and RPN (had and loved a 48GX in school), but I never considered it as a good "development platform".  I'm not sure what it says about Mr. Yegge that he learned to code in RPN on a calculator, but I think it says it very loudly.

For the record, I taught myself to program in BASIC on a VIC-20 with a cassette tape drive (circa 1983).  But at least it had a QWERTY keyboard ... "Luxury":http://www.phespirit.info/montypython/four_yorkshiremen.htm.
