Finally got around to attending the [Seattle Ruby Brigade](http://www.seattlerb.org/) last night, although I feel a bit silly about forgetting to bring my laptop to “Hack Night”. Still, I had interesting conversations with [Ryan Lonac](http://rwldesign.com/) about all things Ruby, with someone (a Jennifer) who could actually make use of MP3 validation if I added it to [assert\_valid\_content](http://github.com/CodeMonkeySteve/assert_valid_content), and with a couple of other cool people who’s names my brain was too feeble to retain.

Still working my way through the [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/) (up up to 2009 already!). It doesn’t help that I found the [Rails Envy Podcast](http://railsenvy.com/), which is another interesting time-sink. Along the way I also discovered [video from GoRuCo 2008](http://goruco2008.confreaks.com/index.html) and found the presentation from [Giles Bowkett](http://goruco2008.confreaks.com/02_bowkett.html) equal parts brilliant and hilarious.

Finally, I’ve refactored my resume to show of my Mad Ruby Skillz a bit more. If anyone out there knows anyone out there who’s looking for a Serious Ruby/Rails Geek, please pass it along and have them drop me a line.
