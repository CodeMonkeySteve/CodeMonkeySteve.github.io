... or, er, Something Else!

If you haven't noticed the trend, the fact that I'm updating this blog means I'm once again between jobs.  I've decided that I'm getting sick of C/C++, and really need a daily dose of sweet, sweet Ruby Goodness.  To that end, I'm on the hunt for what will probably end up being a Rails gig, preferably closer to home than downtown Seattle.

So in between job googling, I'm polishing my Rails skills a little and catching up on (two years of) the "Ruby on Rails Podcast":http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/ .
