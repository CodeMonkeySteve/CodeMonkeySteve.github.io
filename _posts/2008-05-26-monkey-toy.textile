I have recently become the proud owner of a "Nokia 810 Internet Tablet":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810, and it is truly a sweet bit o' hardware.  It's essentially a pocket computer, with (almost) all of the features of a laptop PC (yes, it runs Linux).  In fact, SWMBO (who's had one for quite a while) has been running KDE on it. I suspect one factor in my acquiring it is the increased chance of customer bug fixes for her (not that there's anything wrong with that!).

So, as much as I like Qt, I haven't yet bothered installing KDE, and instead have been looking into setting up the "cross-compiling environment":http://scratchbox.org/documentation/user/scratchbox-1.0/
 for "Maemo":http://maemo.org/development/documentation/tutorials/maemo_4-0_tutorial.html, the built-in desktop.  Once I can get Hello World running, I can look into fixing DPMI ... ;)
