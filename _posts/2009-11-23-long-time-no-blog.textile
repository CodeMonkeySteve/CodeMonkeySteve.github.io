It seems to work out that when I'm most busy coding, I have the least time to blog (and vice-versa).  That's my official excuse for it being two months since my last update: work has been busy.

First, at the beginning of October, me and the Kashless Krew  went to "AlohaOnRails":http://www.alohaonrails.com/, my first Ruby/Rails conference in sunny (read: "sweltering") O'ahu, Hawai'i:

The conference was a lot of fun: got to hear about some neat Rails tech and meet some of the "rock stars":http://onestepback.org/ in the Ruby world.

I've also been continuing my exploration of "No-SQL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL databases.  While I still love the design of "CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/, I've been playing with "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ and "MongoMapper":http://railstips.org/2009/6/27/mongomapper-the-rad-mongo-wrapper.  Mongo is a bit more mature, even if it does still have a whiff of the SQL smell about it.  I'll have more Useful Information about that later.

The other thing I've been learning is the "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ testing framework.  When I first looked into it a few years back, I found the RSpec syntax unwieldy compared with Test::Unit.  But after having to do various hacky things to make Shoulda run decently (e.g. "fast_context":http://github.com/lifo/fast_context) and even contemplating writing my own framework (the now defunct "Mustard":http://github.com/CodeMonkeySteve/mustard), I've come to appreciate the RSpec Way and can't see myself ever going back.
