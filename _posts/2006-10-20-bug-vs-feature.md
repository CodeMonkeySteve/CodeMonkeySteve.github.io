title: Bug vs. Feature
---
A common topic of ~~argument~~ debate amongst coders has always been whether a particular set of behavior constitutes a bug or a [feature](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/f/feature.html) (or even a [misfeature](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/m/misfeature.html)). After many years of contemplation (and argument), I have come up with a test which I believe can make a definitive classification:

> A set of behaviors is a **feature** *if and only if* it can be
> ignored, disabled, circumvented, disregarded, removed, deactivated or
> otherwise configured to be completely unnoticeable by the user.
> Otherwise, it’s a **bug** (or, at best, a misfeature).

As an example I offer autombile air-bags, a fantastic life-saving device, except when it’s child-killing monstrosity. The solution? Add a switch to selectively disable them. <code>Bug + Switch = Feature</code>.

*QED*
