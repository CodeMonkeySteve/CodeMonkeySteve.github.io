title: "Typo w/ Rails Installer: The New Hotness"
---
So I had this very long and in-depth article almost-completely written article, detailing the nifty hacks I used to deploy [this website](http://www.onebananaproblem.com) on top of [Typo](http://typosphere.org), using [Capistrano](http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17) and a litle script to symlink them together. It was beautiful and elegant â€¦ and now completely useless thanks to [Typo 4](http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/trackback/2646) .

The magic is in the [Rails Installer](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rails-installer/), a handy little gem for doing end-user installs. Makes my elegant little hacks a little silly.

*sigh*
