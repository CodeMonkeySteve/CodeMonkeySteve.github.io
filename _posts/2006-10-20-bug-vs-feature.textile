title: Bug vs. Feature
---
A common topic of -argument- debate amongst coders has always been whether a particular set of behavior constitutes a bug or a "feature":http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/f/feature.html (or even a "misfeature":http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/m/misfeature.html).  After many years of contemplation (and argument), I have come up with a test which I believe can make a definitive classification:

bq. A set of behaviors is a *feature* _if and only if_ it can be ignored, disabled, circumvented, disregarded, removed, deactivated or otherwise configured to be completely unnoticeable by the user.  Otherwise, it's a *bug* (or, at best, a misfeature).

As an example I offer autombile air-bags, a fantastic life-saving device, except when it's child-killing monstrosity. The solution?  Add a switch to selectively disable them.  <code>Bug + Switch = Feature</code>.

_QED_
