Gooday, eh? This is my coding blog, and welcome to it.

First, I should probably give credit for the inspiration for this blog to the [Ruby on Rails Podcast](podcast.rubyonrails.com). It introduced me to the Ruby and Rails community, and some of the cool stuff people are doing with it ([BDD](rspec.rubyforge.org) especially caught my ear). I decided that I had enough thoughts rolling around in my head that might be of use or interest to others, that I should hop on the blog-wagon.

I’m also using this site as a test-bed for some Rails experimentation, starting with using [Typo](typosphere.org) as a base, to which I can add some of my own Rails goodness.

Enjoy …
