I may be showing how out of date I am with the Rubyverse, but I just discovered [Duck Punching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_punching):

> Well, I was just totally sold by Adam, the idea being that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, itâ€™s a duck, right? So if this duck is not giving you the noise that you want, youâ€™ve got to just punch that duck until it returns what you expect. â€“ Patrick Ewing

Awesome.

As for [show the whale](http://pratalife.blogspot.com/2008/08/show-whale.html): meh.
