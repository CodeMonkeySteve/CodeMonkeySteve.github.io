<p>As of today, I&#8217;ve been with <a href="http://vigilos.com">Vigilos, Inc.</a> for exactly four months, a fact I was reminded of when the password expiration policy kicked in and I had to track down the admin to reset it.  While my days have been spent slogging through old crappy C code (and replacing it with shiny new C++ code), I been spend<br />
ing evenings and weekends getting reacquainted with Ruby on Rails.  This has been inspired in large part by the Second Edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/amabot/?pf_rd_url=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0974514055%2Fref%3Dpd_cp_b_title%2F102-6241858-0226508&amp;pf_rd_p=252362401&amp;pf_rd_s=center-41&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0977616630&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=00B19H2M1TJWAHKNJJ56">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>, an excellent book, both as tutorial and reference, and I highly recommend it to anyone doing Rails development.</p>
<p>After perusing the book cover-to-cover on my daily bus commute, I decided it was time to go back and rewrite my nominal web site (<a href="http://finagle.org">finagle.org</a>).  This was my first Rails project, back when Rails was only up to version <em>0.10</em>, and had quite a bit of cruft due to the ancient version (lots of stuff has changed since then) and my own lack of Ruby/Rails experience. Starting from scratch, following the book closely, and salvaging chunks of code from the original version, produced a much smaller and cleaner implementation.</p>
<p>Along the way, I also learned some new an interesting Rails development tricks.  I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> on my PowerBook laptop (<em>sooo</em> much more responsive than running KDevelop over X11), which is a nice little <span class="caps">IDE</span>.  My only gripe is that it doesn&#8217;t support <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">autotest</a>, but it&#8217;s easy enough to run that in a shell.  I&#8217;ve also been using some rather spiffy plugins, some new some old:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://svn.toolbocks.com/plugins/manage_fixtures">manage_fixtures</a> allows for easy export/import of <span class="caps">YAML</span> fixtures to/from the data base,</li>
	<li><a href="svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/acts_as_textiled">acts_as_textiled</a> handles converting models&#8217; Textile markup into <span class="caps">HTML</span>,</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.realityforge.org/svn/public/code/assert-valid-asset/trunk">assert-valid-asset</a> is a great tool for automagically validating <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>.</li>
	<li><a href="svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/backgroundrb">backgroundrb</a> provides facilities for executing long-running (or persistant) processes, and tying them into Rails.</li>
	<li>Finally, I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://svn.eastmedia.com/svn/bantay/plugins/open_id_consumer">open_id_consumer</a> plugin to handle logins via <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.  Username/password is <em>so</em> Web 1.0. ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up I need to hone my <span class="caps">CSS</span> skills a bit, maybe get a good <em>Agile Web</em>-style book on making pretty web themes.  Any suggestions?</p>
