<p>I haven&#8217;t updated this blog in an embarrassingly long  time, but I can put the blame on Typo and/or DreamHost: posting an article would consistently and silently fail.  Meh.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m experimenting with <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> instead, and while it doesn&#8217;t seem to some of the nice sidebar features, it does at least work, and was fairly easy to setup.  Hopefully now I&#8217;ll actually be able to get some content up here.</p>
