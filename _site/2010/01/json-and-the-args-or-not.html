<p>(Admittedly not my best work, but it&#8217;s hard coming up with <span class="caps">JSON</span> puns)</p>
<p>Playing with <span class="caps">JSON</span> Document Stores has led me down the path to a few other exciting <span class="caps">JSON</span> toys.  The first is &#8230;</p>
<h1><a href="http://json-schema.org"><span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema</a></h1>
<p>Just like <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema"><span class="caps">XML</span> Schema</a>, <a href="http://json-schema.org"><span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema</a> allows you to specify (in <span class="caps">JSON</span> form) the semantics of a particular <span class="caps">JSON</span> data structure.  While in theory the schema is useful for validation, in practice validation just sucks up too much <span class="caps">CPU</span> time to be worth the trouble.  Where things get really interesting is the possibility of automatically generating user interfaces that compose <span class="caps">JSON</span>-based messages behind the scenes.  There&#8217;s just one thing missing &#8230;</p>
<h1><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/json-schema/web/service-mapping-description-proposal" title="SMD">Service Mapping Description</a></h1>
<p>Ta-da! <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/json-schema/web/service-mapping-description-proposal"><span class="caps">SMD</span></a> allows you to describe all of the methods of a web service using  <a href="http://json-schema.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema</a> to describe each method&#8217;s parameters. It supports a variety of transports and envelopes from simple GETs or POSTs up through RESTful resources and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC"><span class="caps">JSON</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span></a>.</p>
<p>The beauty of all of this is that it allows for services (web and otherwise) to advertise its functionality in user- and computer-readable ways.  It has the potential to be a generic communication mechanism between disparate bits of software (potentially controlling hardware), allowing us to virtually wire-up appliance X to service Y through user interface Z, without any of them having prior knowledge of each other.  Pretty sweet.</p>
<h1>You Are <code>'Here':{}</code> &#8230;</h1>
<p>One last bit of <span class="caps">JSON</span> goodness: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>.  As you might expect, it&#8217;s a standard for representing geographic information in <span class="caps">JSON</span>.  It&#8217;s already the de facto standard, and supported by just about everybody.</p>
