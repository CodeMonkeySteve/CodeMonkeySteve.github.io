        <div class="post-body">
        <p>Greetings, everyone!  Welcome to my new-and-improved blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to merge my coding blog (&#8220;One-Banana Problem&#8221;), which has gone woefully under-updated, with my website (&#8220;finagle.org&#8221;), which is gone woefully under-used, and you&#8217;re now looking at the result.  If you&#8217;re thinking it looks a lot like One-Banana Problem &#8230;</p>
<ol>
	<li>You actually read my blog? Wow thanks, you&#8217;re awesome, that almost doubles my audience!</li>
	<li>It looks the same because it&#8217;s a port of the original content and style from <span class="caps">OBP</span> to a new platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why a new platform?  I&#8217;m glad you asked, therein lies the story &#8230;</p>
<h5>The Story</h5>
<p>It all started a few months back, when I went to compose a long-overdue <span class="caps">OBP</span> post, and discovered that Mephisto wasn&#8217;t letting me login.  How rude.  A quick Google not only failed to provide a solution to the problem, but indicated that Mephisto was no longer maintained or supported.  The consensus appeared to be to migrate to a combination of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator, and the <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> commenting system.  Over the months since, I&#8217;ve followed the same path, deploying the new blog on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, my preferred hosting service.  Porting the content was fairly easy, but porting the theme not so much.</p>
<h5>Jekyll</h5>
<p>The best I can say about Jekyll is that it works well enough to get things running again.  At first, I was considering using it for some static brochure sites for friends and family, but after getting it working I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s not good for me for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No <a href="http://haml-lang.com"><span class="caps">HAML</span></a> support. Although there are lots of hacks and extensions that claim to fix this, I could never get any of them to work.</li>
	<li>Heroku provides Varnish to automatically cache pages, so generating static <span class="caps">HTML</span> content doesn&#8217;t give any significant speed improvement.</li>
	<li>I do have to check-in all that static content to Git, which just needlessly bloats the Heroku slug.</li>
	<li>Heroku provides a Rack interface, which means I still need to use a (tiny) <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> app to serve that static content.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I can appreciate the idea of storing the content in the blog code itself, with metadata in a <span class="caps">YAML</span> header block and the copy in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a>, I think I&#8217;ll stick to Sinatra for my static sites.  I&#8217;m already working on a <span class="caps">CMS</span>-ish project that will probably replace Jekyll as soon as it&#8217;s done enough.</p>
<h5>Moving Forward</h5>
<p>I originally started One-Banana Problem in 2006, after getting laid-off from a failing startup.  I wanted to make the switch from a C++ developer to a Ruby/Rails guy, and I thought a blog would help not only to share my hard-won knowledge, but also to market myself to the Rails community in hopes of finding a good job.  To that end, I tried to keep the tone professional and the content mostly related to Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>But here we are, five years later, and now I&#8217;m living living the dream of a full-time Ruby developer (woo-hoo!).  However, having achieved that goal, I find myself with less motivation for blogging, and more importantly, with less time.</p>
<p>To counter this trend I&#8217;ve decided that, as part of The Great Blog Renaming, that I would expand the scope from a mostly coding-centric blog, to including hacking of all kinds.  I am a geek, after all, and to my brain all problems have technological solutions.  I have some interesting ideas for things like secure voting, digital currency, and even improvements to the democratic process (which hasn&#8217;t changed significantly in centuries), and I&#8217;ll try to find the time to comment on these sorts of political and social issues more freely in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also come to the conclusion that trying to keep things &#8220;professional&#8221; is boring and pointless.  If you can&#8217;t be open an honest bastard with the whole Internet, viewable by all and archive forever, then why bother blogging?</p>
