<p>I&#8217;ve been wrangling with CouchDB for a few weeks now, and it&#8217;s starting to feel a bit like this:</p>

<p>(Ooh, my first embedded video.  Feel the Web 2.0 Awesome-ness-age-ality).</p>
<p>First, let me say that I can&#8217;t really blame CouchDB for any of my troubles, which are essentially:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are a excess of Ruby/Rails gems for accessing CouchDB, all of whom have different dependencies and do things in slightly different ways.  I&#8217;m sure that eventually a consensus will emerge on the best Ruby/CouchDB way of doing things, but it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.</li>
	<li>CouchDB is not yet 1.0, so the design can support <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/docs/overview.html">lots of spiffy features</a> that <em>don&#8217;t actually exist yet</em>.  Specifically, the lack of partial replication stalled my attempts at using Couch for a distributed media server project.</li>
	<li>CouchDB doesn&#8217;t work perfectly for absolutely everything (whoda thunkit?).  My other big project (more on that later) isn&#8217;t really Document-Oriented, no matter how much I try to beat it flat.  I&#8217;m now thinking Git is actually be best storage solution, and if you understand Gits internals well enough, you&#8217;ll see how mind-warping that concept is.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think I&#8217;ll put CouchDB down for a while, at least until 1.0, or until I run across a project where it&#8217;s appropriate.  Of course, it&#8217;s still a gazillion times better than any <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> &#8230;</p>
