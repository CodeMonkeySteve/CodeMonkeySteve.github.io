<p>I&#8217;m falling in love (or at least lust) with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, especially after seeing this <a href="http://aac2009.confreaks.com/07-feb-2009-16-00-relaxing-with-couchdb-will-leinweber.html">presentation at <span class="caps">AAC</span></a> and this <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/2008/08/30/jan-lehnardt-talks-to-the-bbc-about-couchdb">presentation for the <span class="caps">BBC</span></a>.  My summary: <span class="caps">JSON</span> document storage, sliced-and-diced with Javascript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_reduce">MapReduce</a>, all served on a RESTful platter.</p>
<p>As a long-time <span class="caps">XML</span> fanboy, the lack of schema in <span class="caps">JSON</span> makes me a bit twitchy, and using Javascript as a query language just looks a lttle wrong.  But I see the advantages to the document-centric model (versioning, replication, access control) and MapReduce is definitely the Wave of the <del>Future</del> Present.  It looks like you can encapsulate all of your model logic in views, so I&#8217;m not sure if an explicit schema is really even necessary.  The more I learn about <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com/2009/03/31/the-case-of-activerecord-vs-couchdb/">That Way of doing things</a>, the more it grows on me.</p>
<p>So how do we make CouchDB play nicely with Rails?  I first tried <a href="http://github.com/arunthampi/activecouch">activecouch</a>, but found its lack of Ruby-type casts and one-database-per-model scheme irritating.  <a href="http://github.com/langalex/couch_potato">couch_potato</a> definitely looks slicker, but there seems to be quite a few  <a href="http://github.com/search?type=Repositories&amp;language=rb&amp;q=couchdb">other CouchDB interfaces</a> out there that might be just as good or better.  I see this as a good sign that many others also see CouchDB&#8217;s potential, and are experimenting with ways to deal with it in a Ruby Way.</p>
