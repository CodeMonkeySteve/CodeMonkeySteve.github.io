<p>Finally got around to attending the <a href="http://www.seattlerb.org/">Seattle Ruby Brigade</a> last night, although I feel a bit silly about forgetting to bring my laptop to &#8220;Hack Night&#8221;.  Still, I had interesting conversations with <a href="http://rwldesign.com/">Ryan Lonac</a> about all things Ruby, with someone (a Jennifer) who could actually make use of MP3 validation if I added it to <a href="http://github.com/CodeMonkeySteve/assert_valid_content">assert_valid_content</a>, and with a couple of other cool people who&#8217;s names my brain was too feeble to retain.</p>
<p>Still working my way through the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Podcast</a> (up up to 2009 already!).  It doesn&#8217;t help that I found the <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Rails Envy Podcast</a>, which is another interesting time-sink.  Along the way I also discovered <a href="http://goruco2008.confreaks.com/index.html">video from GoRuCo 2008</a> and found the presentation from &quot;Giles Bowkett &quot;:http://goruco2008.confreaks.com/02_bowkett.html equal parts brilliant and hilarious.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve refactored my resume to show of my Mad Ruby Skillz a bit more.  If anyone out there knows anyone out there who&#8217;s looking for a Serious Ruby/Rails Geek, please pass it along and have them drop me a line.</p>
