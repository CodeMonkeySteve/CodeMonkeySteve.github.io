<p>I may be showing how out of date I am with the Rubyverse, but I just discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_punching">Duck Punching</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Well, I was just totally sold by Adam, the idea being that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, itâ€™s a duck, right? So if this duck is not giving you the noise that you want, youâ€™ve got to just punch that duck until it returns what you expect.<br />
