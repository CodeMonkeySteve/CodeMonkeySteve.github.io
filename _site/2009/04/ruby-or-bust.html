<p>&#8230; or, er, Something Else!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed the trend, the fact that I&#8217;m updating this blog means I&#8217;m once again between jobs.  I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m getting sick of C/C++, and really need a daily dose of sweet, sweet Ruby Goodness.  To that end, I&#8217;m on the hunt for what will probably end up being a Rails gig, preferably closer to home than downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>So in between job googling, I&#8217;m polishing my Rails skills a little and catching up on (two years of) the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Podcast</a> .</p>
