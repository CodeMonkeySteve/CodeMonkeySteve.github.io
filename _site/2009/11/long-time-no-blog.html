<p>It seems to work out that when I&#8217;m most busy coding, I have the least time to blog (and vice-versa).  That&#8217;s my official excuse for it being two months since my last update: work has been busy.</p>
<p>First, at the beginning of October, me and the Kashless Krew  went to <a href="http://www.alohaonrails.com/">AlohaOnRails</a>, my first Ruby/Rails conference in sunny (read: &#8220;sweltering&#8221;) O&#8217;ahu, Hawai&#8217;i:</p>

<p>The conference was a lot of fun: got to hear about some neat Rails tech and meet some of the <a href="http://onestepback.org/">rock stars</a> in the Ruby world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been continuing my exploration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">No-<span class="caps">SQL</span></a> databases.  While I still love the design of <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://railstips.org/2009/6/27/mongomapper-the-rad-mongo-wrapper">MongoMapper</a>.  Mongo is a bit more mature, even if it does still have a whiff of the <span class="caps">SQL</span> smell about it.  I&#8217;ll have more Useful Information about that later.</p>
<p>The other thing I&#8217;ve been learning is the <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> testing framework.  When I first looked into it a few years back, I found the RSpec syntax unwieldy compared with Test::Unit.  But after having to do various hacky things to make Shoulda run decently (e.g. <a href="http://github.com/lifo/fast_context">fast_context</a>) and even contemplating writing my own framework (the now defunct <a href="http://github.com/CodeMonkeySteve/mustard">Mustard</a>), I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the RSpec Way and can&#8217;t see myself ever going back.</p>
