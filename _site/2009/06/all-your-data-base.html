<p>After failing to make <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> doing anything useful, and being completely unwilling to go back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql">1974</a> I decided to go back and revisit my assumptions.  Both of my current home projects are essentially attempts to treat real-world interactions as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">Routing Problems</a>, but after doing some research, I decided that was one wheel I didn&#8217;t even want to attempt to reinvent (graph theory is not my specialty).</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I discovered what I really needed was a <em>Graph Database</em>.  That led me to apparently the only significant implementation: <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>, an embedded Java graph database. But I&#8217;d rather juggle flaming porcupines than touch Java again &#8230; and thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jruby">JRuby</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j">neo4j gem</a>, I don&#8217;t have to!  Yay!</p>
<p>So if your problem domain is graph-like, you should definitely checkout <a href="http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j">neo4j</a>, it&#8217;s looking like a seriously sweet storage solution.</p>
