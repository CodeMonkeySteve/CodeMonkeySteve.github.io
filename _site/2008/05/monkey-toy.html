<p>I have recently become the proud owner of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">Nokia 810 Internet Tablet</a>, and it is truly a sweet bit o&#8217; hardware.  It&#8217;s essentially a pocket computer, with (almost) all of the features of a laptop PC (yes, it runs Linux).  In fact, <span class="caps">SWMBO</span> (who&#8217;s had one for quite a while) has been running <span class="caps">KDE</span> on it. I suspect one factor in my acquiring it is the increased chance of customer bug fixes for her (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that!).</p>
<p>So, as much as I like Qt, I haven&#8217;t yet bothered installing <span class="caps">KDE</span>, and instead have been looking into setting up the <a href="http://scratchbox.org/documentation/user/scratchbox-1.0/">cross-compiling environment</a><br />
 for <a href="http://maemo.org/development/documentation/tutorials/maemo_4-0_tutorial.html">Maemo</a>, the built-in desktop.  Once I can get Hello World running, I can look into fixing <span class="caps">DPMI</span> &#8230; ;)</p>
