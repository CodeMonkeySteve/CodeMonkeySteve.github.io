<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past month or so learning the ins and outs of <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, and am in the process of converting from Subversion, both at work and for my personal projects.  Others <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git">have written</a> about <a href="http://blog.madism.org/index.php/2007/09/09/138-git-awsome-ness-git-rebase-interactive">Git&#8217;s awesomeness</a>, and there are various of <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSvnComparsion">comparisons with Subversion</a>.</p>
<p>However, I think that comparing Git with Subversion as Version Control Systems is entirely missing the point:  Git is a Source Code Management tool, although it can also be used for version control.  The point of GIt is not to track the various versions of a project, but a connected series of <em>individual changes</em> made by individual developers.  The change- and developer-centric view also makes for meaningful collaboration, instead of restricting access to a central Subversion server.</p>
<p>It is, undoubtedly, the New Hotness, and every coder should use it (or some other real <span class="caps">SCM</span> tool).</p>
