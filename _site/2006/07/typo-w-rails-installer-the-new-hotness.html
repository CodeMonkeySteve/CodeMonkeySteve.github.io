<p>So I had this very long and in-depth article almost-completely written article, detailing the nifty hacks I used to deploy <a href="http://www.onebananaproblem.com">this website</a> on top of <a href="http://typosphere.org">Typo</a>, using <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">Capistrano</a> and a litle script to symlink them together.  It was beautiful and elegant &#8230; and now completely useless thanks to <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/trackback/2646">Typo 4</a> .</p>
<p>The magic is in the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rails-installer/">Rails Installer</a>, a handy little gem for doing end-user installs.  Makes my elegant little hacks a little silly.</p>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
