<p>Gooday, eh? This is my coding blog, and welcome to it.</p>
<p>First, I should probably give credit for the inspiration for this blog to the <a href="podcast.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails Podcast</a>. It introduced me to the Ruby  and Rails community, and some of the cool stuff people are doing with it (<a href="rspec.rubyforge.org"><span class="caps">BDD</span></a> especially caught my ear).  I decided that I had enough thoughts rolling around in my head that might be of use or interest to others, that I should hop on the blog-wagon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also using this site as a test-bed for some Rails experimentation, starting with using <a href="typosphere.org">Typo</a> as a base, to which I can add some of my own Rails goodness.</p>
<p>Enjoy &#8230;</p>
