<p>If you&#8217;re reading my obscure blog, you probably saw the <a href="http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/35616214/article.pl">article on Slashdot</a> linking to a <a href="http://sztywny.titaniumhosting.com/2006/07/23/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answers/">blog article</a> where various notable programmers answer questions about their history and preferences.  My favorite has got to be:</p>

<p><em>How did you learn programming? Were any schools of any use? Or maybe you didn&#8217;t even bother with ending any schools :) ?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a></strong>:<br />
I taught myself to program on an HP calculator using their <span class="caps">RPN</span> stack language when I was 17 years old.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m a big fan of HP calculators and <span class="caps">RPN</span> (had and loved a 48GX in school), but I never considered it as a good &#8220;development platform&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not sure what it says about Mr. Yegge that he learned to code in <span class="caps">RPN</span> on a calculator, but I think it says it very loudly.</p>
<p>For the record, I taught myself to program in <span class="caps">BASIC</span> on a <span class="caps">VIC</span>-20 with a cassette tape drive (circa 1983).  But at least it had a <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> keyboard &#8230; <a href="http://www.phespirit.info/montypython/four_yorkshiremen.htm">Luxury</a>.</p>
