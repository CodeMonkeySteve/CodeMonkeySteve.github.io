<p>A common topic of <del>argument</del> debate amongst coders has always been whether a particular set of behavior constitutes a bug or a <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/f/feature.html">feature</a> (or even a <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/m/misfeature.html">misfeature</a>).  After many years of contemplation (and argument), I have come up with a test which I believe can make a definitive classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of behaviors is a <strong>feature</strong> <em>if and only if</em> it can be ignored, disabled, circumvented, disregarded, removed, deactivated or otherwise configured to be completely unnoticeable by the user.  Otherwise, it&#8217;s a <strong>bug</strong> (or, at best, a misfeature).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example I offer autombile air-bags, a fantastic life-saving device, except when it&#8217;s child-killing monstrosity. The solution?  Add a switch to selectively disable them.  <code>Bug + Switch = Feature</code>.</p>
<p><em><span class="caps">QED</span></em></p>
